## 2 Semester Hairdresser Project

## Project Requirements

### Hard Requirements:
* Employees must be able to log in and out of the system.
* It must be possible to create and delete appointments.
* It must be possible to look up appointments and make changes to them.
* Appointments must not conflict - an employee can only serve one customer at a time.
* The appointment must include the treatment and how long the treatment takes.
* The system must store data in a structured and permanent manner.
* Tax authorities require that appointments be kept in the system for 5 years as documentation - an appointment can be canceled but must remain in the system as canceled. After 5 years, appointments should be automatically deleted at appropriate intervals - for example, once a month or once a year. Consider how this can be solved - if possible, construct the solution.

### Soft Requirements:
* The user interface may preferably be graphical.
* Employees' and customers' data should be secured - what can be done in this regard?
* Customers could potentially receive receipts or notifications via email or SMS - how could this be implemented?
* Eventually, customers should be able to book appointments themselves - this could be online and/or via an app. How can the system be designed to make this possible?
* Monica might also like to follow along on her computer and/or phone.

### Educational (Academic) Requirements:
* Agile system development tools must be used, and UML tools should be used in the project.
* The system should primarily be programmed in Java.
