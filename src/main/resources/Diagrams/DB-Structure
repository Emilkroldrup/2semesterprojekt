Explanations:
PK (Primary Key): Uniquely identifies each record within a table. Auto-incremented to ensure uniqueness.

FK (Foreign Key): Establishes a relationship between two tables. For instance, customerId in the Appointments table references the id in the Customers table, creating a link between an appointment and its respective customer.

Indices: Created on frequently searched columns (like email in Employees) or columns used in joins (like customerId and employeeId in Appointments) to speed up query performance.

Constraints: Ensure data integrity across related tables, e.g., an appointment cannot exist without a valid customer and employee.

This should be ensuring clear relationships between entities and efficient data retrieval through indices and constraints. The database setup is made following the application's requirements for managing employees, customers, appointments, and treatments effectively, // maybe with log entries for auditing or debugging purposes.
